                    <p>The Christian Philosophy Teaching Cooperative is a collective of teacher-owned and operated schools for middle- and high-school age students, dedicated to providing a rigorous liberal arts education and to strengthening faith in Jesus, whom God anointed to save a people gathered out of every nation from sin and death, and grant them life in his spirit.</p>
                    <p>Our curriculum places strong emphases on philosophy, the mathematical sciences (including applications in physics and computer science), foreign language acquisition, and the common theology and biblical interpretation of the first Christian millennium.</p>

                    <h3>Teaching Christianity</h3>
                    <p>The proper operation of a Christian school requires both immersion in Christian thought and practice in Christian living. A learning environment where faith is practiced but not studied cultivates students who are zealous but unrooted. One where it is studied but not practiced cultivates students who are informed but undevoted. For this reason, we offer core courses on the various books of the bible, as well as on the theological writings of early Greek and Latin Christians like Augustine and Basil the Great. Study is punctuated by the praying of the psalms and reading of scripture several times daily.</p>
                    <h3>Living the faith</h3>
                    <p>The Christian Philosophy Teaching Cooperative  adheres to the common teaching established and articulated in the Apostles' and Nicene-Constantinopolitan creeds. It is not affiliated with any Christian denomination, and emphasizes the teachings and practices found in Christian authors of the first eight centuries. Teachers and student families must be regularly attending members of a church community, and should not condone or participate in activities condemned in the New Testament.</p>

                    <p>Philosophy is the study of the nature, meaning, unity, order, and goodness of the universe as a whole.  The term, coined in the fourth century BC by the Greek philosopher Plato, means 'love of wisdom'.</p>
